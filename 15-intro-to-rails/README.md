# Intro to Rails
Today we'll collectively dive into the auto-magic of Rails by creating our first Rails application, together!

## Our Goals
- Create a new Rails application
- Describe similarities between Sinatra routing & Rails routing
- Generate a controller
- Create views
- Generate a model
- Create routes

## Thanks, Sinatra! 
Today we say goodbye to Sinatra and hello to Rails. Here's a little parting gift: [![Sinatra](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9ML8PrP3A8E/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ML8PrP3A8E)


## What is Rails? 
Rails was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson, while working on the code base for Basecamp, a project management tool by 37signals. David extracted Ruby on Rails and officially released it as open source code in July of 2004. Despite rapid iteration of the Rails code base throughout the years, it has stuck to three basic principles:

- Ruby Programming Language
- Model-View-Controller Architecture
- Programmer Happiness

Rails was created with the goal of increasing programmers' happiness and productivity levels. 

In short, with Rails you can get started with a full-stack web application by quickly creating pages, templates and even query functions.

Rails heavily emphasizes `"Convention over Configuration."` This means that a programmer only needs to specify and code out the non-standard parts of a program. Even though Rails comes with its own set of tools and settings, you're certainly not limited to library of rails commands and configurations. Developers are free to configure their applications however they wish, though adopting conventions is certainly recommended.

Over the years, Rails has indeed made it easier for beginners to dive into web development and build large complex applications. Some popular websites built on Rails include Twitter (at one point), GitHub and, of course, 37signals' very own Basecamp. `Although it has often been criticized for performance and bloat,` Rails continues its iterations with an ever-growing developer community and a vibrant ecosystem.

## Let's Build a Blog! 

It's actually possible to create a website with a lot of the functionality you've seen in our Sinatra app – forms, links, database, and MVC structure – in less than 5 minutes. We will not detail each step for this app, but we will create a dynamic website in 5 mins by typing the following commands.

```rb
rails new blog_app

cd blog_app

rails generate scaffold Post title:string content:text author:string

rake db:migrate

rails server
```
Now we'll head over to localhost:3000/posts. All of our REST actions are live!

## Code-along Time- Petstore App

Let's install rails: 

```rb
gem install rails
```
Versions of Rails change quite rapidly, and if you leave off the "-v", you'll just get the latest version. Be specific if you want a specific version.

```rb
  gem install rails -v=INSERT_RAILS_VERSION_HERE
```

### Creating a Rails App

For this introduction, we want to create a simple app: a petstore! The specs for this app are as follows:

- Display a list of all pets
- Create new pets and edit existing pets
- Delete pets

This structure may look a bit complex – there a lot of files, specific naming conventions, and some nested files and folders. We generally don't create this structure manually, but instead use the Rails command line tool, which initializes the app for us:

```rb
rails new petstore
```

Note: By default, if you do not add any option for the database, Rails will create the app with SQLite3. While you are working in a local development environment (localhost), you won't notice much of a difference between SQLite3 and PostgreSQL.

Once your app is in production on a remote server, you will not use SQLite, and they will often use PostgreSQL. A best practice in web development is to keep development and production environments as similar as possible, so we recommend using PostgreSQL from the start.

Now, let's go into the petstore folder:

```rb
cd petstore
```

Let's look at the contents of this folder (using ls), and take a look at the files and folders that were magically created by the rails new command:

```rb
├── app
├── bin
├── config
├── db
├── lib
├── log
├── public
├── test
├── tmp
└── vendor
```

Some details about this structure:

- 90% of the web app code will be inside the folder app, including all of our model, view, and controller logic.

- config contains all the credentials for the DB and other 3rd party services, all the deployment settings, and the specs about how to serve this app over HTTP.

- db will contain all of your migrations

We will describe the other folders in later lessons, and for the next couple of weeks, you will primarily write code inside the folders described above.

### Rails Routing vs. Sinatra Routing
As you know, a "route" is a combination of the path that was requested and the HTTP verb that was used to request that path.

When we've used Sinatra, we were managing the routes and the code executed for a specific route in the same place:

```rb
    get "/pets" do
        # Here is the code that will be executed when the client requests /books
    end
```
This is handy for us as developers, because it allows us to keep everything in the same place - routing and controller logic - but if the app grows it can get unreadable. Imagine, for example, an app that has 20 or 30 different routes... your main routes file could contain a lot of complex code.

Rails has a "routing engine" that separates the routing logic from the controller logic (what we want to happen when routes are requested). The configuration for this routing engine is in the file config/routes.rb.

```rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do

end
```
Everything between the `do` and the `end` will be code related to handling routes for the current application.

Later on in this lesson, we will add some content in this file, and in a later lesson, we will go into detail about handling routes inside a Rails application.

### Generate a controller
As Rails is an MVC framework, we will need to have controllers to handle requests and call the database through models.

In Rails, the controllers are files inside the folder `app/controllers`. If you open this folder, you will see that one controller is already here: the file `application_controller.rb`. This controller does not directly handle HTTP requests, but rather serves as a link between all the controllers we will create, `application_controller.rb` will be the parent of all the controllers in our app.

There are different ways for creating a controller in Rails:

- We can manually create a file and write the ruby code inside it.
- We can use a generator called controller, using rails g controller CONTROLLER_NAME [ACTIONS]. 

For instance, if we want to create a controller for the resource pets with an action and a view for index and show, we would type in the console rails g controller pets index show. This command would create a bunch of files and modify some others:

The controller itself, pets_controller.rb inside app/controllers

The views for each method , in this case

```rb
app/views/index.html.erb
app/views/show.html.erb
```

The routes handlers for these two actions will also be added to `config/routes.rb` :

```rb
get '/pets/index', to: 'pets#index'
get '/pets/show', to: 'pets#show'
```

We can use the scaffold_controller generator. This generator will create the same files as the previous generator but with a REST logic for views, controller and views.

### Create methods for a RESTful controller
We've already defined what a RESTful resource is, let's see how to implement it in a rails app.

As a reminder, a RESTful resource will include 7 methods:

- Index
- Show
- New
- Create
- Edit
- Update
- Delete

Rails has a generator called scaffold that will create the whole MVC structure for a resource, let's say that inside the petstore app, we want the `Pet` resource to have a title and a content field, we would type:

```rb
rails g scaffold Pet name:string animal:string
```
Running this command will generate a lot of files, including the controller, the views, the model, and the migration. It will also update the routes file.

Take a look at the controller, it has all the RESTful methods, and these methods already contain the code to query the database through the model `Pet`.

We don't want all the files created with the scaffold and in practice you won't actually use it so let's delete it:

```rb
rails d scaffold Pet
```

Let's go ahead and generate a new Pets controller.

### Create views
There is no specific generator that will create only a view file, but you can add them manually into the appropriate folder inside views.

For instance, if we want to add a view file about for the resource `Pet`, we can create a file `about.html.erb` in `app/views/pets`.

If a view is "static" - as in, it doesn't use any instance variables created in the controller - you can just create a route for this view and rails will render it in the browser even if there is no method in the controller:

`In config/routes.rb`

```rb
get "/pets/about", to: 'pets#about'
```

If there is a file about.html.erb in app/views/pets, this file will be automatically rendered when you call `localhost:3000/pets/about`.



### Implicit vs Explicit Rendering
Thanks to Rails conventions, we do not need to specify the view file to render in our controller. This is known as implicit rendering.

```rb
In app/controllers/pets

  def index
  end
```

However, if we wanted to be more explicit or if we wanted to rendr a view template that does not correspond with the action name we could do the following:

```rb
  def index
    render 'cats'
    # This will render cats.html.erb
  end
```

### Generate a model
Sometimes, you will need a model but not the related controller, in this case, you will use the model generator:

```rb
rails g model MODEL_NAME [fields]
```

This will generate the model by itself along with the migration containing all the fields and the data types if you wrote them when you typed the console.

### Generate a migration
In Sinatra you had to create your migrations by hand. As with most things in Rails, theres an generator for that.

```rb
rails g migration AddAgeToPets age:integer
```

By following certain conventions like the one above, rails will generate a migration that specifically adds the age column to your existing pets column.

```rb
class AddAgeToPet < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    add_column :pets, :age, :integer
  end
end
```

### Conclusion
Rome wasn't built in a day and neither can someone learn Rails in a day. Keep coding and it will all come together.
